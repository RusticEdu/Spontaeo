# Spontaeo

An application based around Spontaneous Interactions and Games which members engage in with others nearby.  In addition to the former, there will be a traditional meeting platform in which users meetup based around common interests.  If you have any ideas for a spontaneous ventures, please share!

Example Games:

- Spont. Conversation
- Shared Board/Mobile Game
- PointOut: A game where users have to guess which person the member is in a given area.
- Impromtu Tag
- DanceOff(Coordinated, Improv)

-Users have the option of appearing in the location tags and Spontenous feeds by altering a boolean value in their user settings
-Create groups and schedule events
-See who is in your area, and who is down to hang
-Strong impetus to protect user data through platform decentralization
